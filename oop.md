Introduction To Object Oriented Programming
===
Lesson time: 90 minutes

Audience
---
This lesson is intended for students who have some experience with fundamental
procedural programming concepts, particularly **variables**, **scope**, **data
structures** and **functions**. Students should be confident in their ability
to write useful programs, and eager to learn new tools and techniques for
building more complex applications and systems. Familiarity with JavaScript is
useful, but not necessary.

Lesson Materials
---
Students should have access to a Web browser with a JavaScript console, such as
Firefox or Chrome. Examples in this document will use Firefox.

Overview
---
In this lesson, we will introduce students to the important concepts of Object
Oriented programming.  We will start by describing how **classes** enable
programmers to model real-world objects in software, and enforce this idea by
creating a class and **object instances** in a browser's JavaScript console. We
will then explain how **properties** (variables) and **methods** (functions)
give object instances their attributes and behavior. We'll cover the power of
the special`constructor()` method, and the value of **accessors** to read and
mutate object instance properties.

### Instructor Notes

#### Goals
At the end of this section, students will:
  - understand that **classes** are blueprints that can create
      **object** instances.
  - be able to declare **classes**
  - **instantiate** object instances 

#### Tips
Throughout this lesson, we will be alternating instruction with practice to
enforce key concepts and keep students engaged. We will be using the JavaScript
interpreter in a Web browser for exercises, but it's important that students
understand that these concepts are universal. If students get hung up on the
particulars of JavaScript's OOP syntax or mechanics, gently guide them back into
the conceptual realm. After this section, all students should be able type code
into the JavaScript console and execute it while understanding that this is just
one implementation of an OOP interface.

We will often refer to Object Oriented Programming as "OOP," for brevity. But
you may want to says "Object Oriented Programming" to avoid confusion. 

### Teach to the students
Object Oriented Programming (OOP) is a concept in software development that
allows programmers to model real world objects. This paradigm is powerful
because it allows humans to more easily manage complex software by leaning
heavily on our intuitive understanding of the world.

Find an object nearby; a desk, a pencil, a laptop, a colleague, or an
instructor. All of these objects can be described in OOP using **classes**,
which define their properties and behaviors. For example, let's look at a pen.

***Ask the class***
> What are some properties that uniquely describe this specific pen?

    Focus on specific attributes of the pen (or other object) in this example:
    color, length, ink type, printed words, smell, condition, etc.

These are the properties of this specific pen. Some other pen may have
completely different properties, but it will still be a class of object that
humans recognize as "a pen." We can create an abstract model of this type of
object using a class, and generalize all pen properties into categories. This
table illustrates how we might  do this, where the first column is the abstract
property, and the other two columns are concrete properties held by specific
instances of the class of object we know as "a pen:"

| abstract property | pen 1      | pen 2      |
| ---               | ---        | ---        |
| manufacturer      | Bic        | Montblanc  |
| material          | plastic    | solid gold |
| refillable        | false      | true       |
| tip               | ballpoint  | nib        |
| color             | white      | gold       |
| length            | 5"         | 6.5"       |
| cost              | 0.79       | 1600.00    |

By describing the class of object known as "a pen" in abstract terms, we can
easily describe two wildly different instances such as a disposable ballpoint
pen and an absurdly expensive Montblanc fountain pen.

We can even model intangible things using OOP, such as Web pages, calendar
reminders, ocean temperature readings, and public transportation ridership
trends. We'll focus on real-world objects for now, because they're familiar and
easier to talk about. 

***Ask the class***
> What are some practical applications of modeling things and concepts as
> objects in software?

    Good answers might include:
      - tell a machine how to make a pen
      - track company assets
      - build an employee database
      - run global warming simulations
      - dynamically add or remove busses and trains from the transit system to
        meet demand
      - sell items on an e-commerce Web site 

Let's create a JavaScript class for an object that is becoming increasingly more
familiar in our everyday lives: a robot. 

Before we start, it's important to understand that Object Oriented Programming
is a concept, or a *paradigm*, supported by most popular programming languages.
Some languages, such as Java and C++ are built around this paradigm, while others
such as Python and JavaScript support it, allowing you to freely mix and
match OOP and procedural aspects as you see fit. In this lesson, we will use
JavaScript because it's readily available in Web browsers and gives us instant
feedback without having to compile or build anything. Just keep in mind that the
concepts we'll cover are shared by all languages that support object oriented
programming.

Let's look at the structure of an empty Robot class in JavaScript. Open the
JavaScript console in a browser and enter the following:

```javascript
class Robot {}
```

Congratulations! You have **declared** a Robot class! It does absolutely
nothing, but let's look at its parts:

1. The **class** keyword tells the JavaScript interpreter that we're
   **declaring** a class. In fact, what you just typed is called a **class
   declaration**.
1. The name, *Robot*, gives us (and the JavaScript interpreter) a unique name to
   reference this class later.
1. The body of the class is contained within curly braces, and is currently
   empty. This is where we will define the robot's characteristics and
   behavior.

We can see what we have created by typing `Robot` into the console. The
JavaScript interpreter will respond with whatever the name references in its
memory:

![Robot class in the JavaScript console](img/1_robot_class_in_console.png)

This is how the JavaScript interpreter in Firefox displays an class in memory.
We can expand the arrows to drill down into the `Robot` "function," (JavaScript
represents classes as functions, which we'll talk about in a moment), and we
will quickly descend into a puzzling JavaScript rabbit hole. Let's not do that
right now. The important thing to note is that the interpreter knows that this
class has a name: `Robot`. 

But what do we do with a class? A class is an abstract blueprint for creating
concrete **instances** of itself, called **objects**. This is where OOP gets its
name. In order to create a blue, dancing `Robot` named Marty, we must first
have a blueprint, or **class**, that defines a `Robot`'s attributes and
behavior. 

Even though our `Robot` blueprint is bare-bones, we can already
**instantiate**, or create an instance of, a `Robot` object. Let's make a new
`Robot` instance in the browser console:

```javascript
const marty = new Robot();
```

Here, we are assigning a new instance of the `Robot` class to the variable
`marty`. There are two important parts of the JavaScript syntax for
instantiating an object:
1. The `new` keyword, which tells the interpreter that we are creating a new
   instance of the `Robot` class. This is common in many other languages that
   support OOP.
2. The parentheses following the class name `Robot`, which imply that we are
   actually calling a function.

Let's talk about those parentheses. When we create an object from a class,
JavaScript is quietly calling a function built in to all classes:
`constructor()`. Even though we didn't declare this function, it is automatically
added to every class, and it's the first function--in OOP terms, a
**method**--that gets called when we instantiate an object. We'll talk more
about the usefulness of `constructor()` shortly.

Let's look at the subtle difference between the `Robot` class and the `marty`
instance in the console:

![Robot class in the JavaScript console](img/2_robot_instance_in_console.png)

The console identifies the `Robot` class as the JavaScript type `function`, but
it identifies `marty` is the JavaScript type `Object`. If we expand `marty` by
clicking on the arrow, we see that that he is empty. It will be our job to give
him some **properties** and **methods**.

Properties and Methods

### Instructor Notes

#### Goals
At the end of this section, students will:
  - understand how the default **constructor** method initializes an object
  - understand that `this` is an interface to the **scope** of an object  
  - declare **properties** and **methods** in a **class**
  - be able to override the default constructor to declare object properties
  - instantiate different **objects** from a class
  - call **methods** on an object instance.

#### Tips
While there are some JavaScript idiosyncrasies that can't be avoided while
interacting with classes, don't spend too much time addressing them.  Remind
students that these are learning general concepts that apply to all
OOP-friendly languages, and the particulars of JavaScript OOP can be explored
on their own time.

### Teach to the students

*Attributes* such as name, color and size, are defined using variables called
**properties**.

*Behaviors*, such as speak, move, and destroy are defined using functions
called **methods**. 

Let's flesh out the abstract notion of a `Robot` by adding some **properties**.
Remember that `constructor()` is automatically called when a new object is
instantiated from a class. This method is completely customizable, giving
us an opportunity to do some work when the object is initialized. We'll
use `constructor()` to define properties on a `Robot` instance.

@todo clean up language about objects and instances for consistency. A class defines an object, and we create instances of that object.

Every robot should have a name, so let's start by declaring a `name` property
in the `Robot` class. Refresh your browser to clear out the `Robot` we declared
earlier, and let's redeclare it as follow: 

```javascript
class Robot {
  constructor() {
    this.name = 'Marty';
  }
}
```

@todo update screenshot to only show console interaction, not class definition

![Robot class in the JavaScript console](img/3_robot_name_property_in_console.png)

In JavaScript, class properties are declared using the keyword `this`. `this`
refers to the **scope**, or context, of the object described by the class.
That dot between `this` and `name` is aptly called the **dot operator**. It
provides access to an object instance's properties and methods. In this case,
`this` is an alias for the current object instance. You can think of it as an
object's instance's notion of itself. `this.name = 'Marty'` is analogous an
object instance saying "my name is Marty".

We can reference `this` from anywhere in a class, and have access to the
specific properties and methods of a particular object when it is instantiated.
`this` is common in many languages that support OOP, but it can get a little
tricky in JavaScript because `this` can be used in other contexts outside of
OOP. For now, we only need to remember that we will use `this` when referencing
properties and methods within in a class.

Let's break down what happened in the above example:

1. We created a new `Robot` instance by calling `new Robot()`, and assigned it to
   the `marty` variable
2. `constructor()` was automatically called, assigning the string value `Marty`
   to the instance's `name` property using the `this` keyword
3. We typed `marty` into the console, and it displayed the object instance with
   the `name` property set to `Marty`.

***Ask the class***
> Does this make sense?

    This is a good time to sync up with the class to make sure everyone is on
    the same page. `this` may be problematic. Enforce the idea that `this` is
    synonymous with "my". It's abstract within the class, but it will be bound to
    the scope of object instances, as we'll demonstrate in a moment.

Now we're going to interact with Marty. We're going to read his name by
directly referencing the `name` property on the object instance using the **dot
operator**:

![Robot class in the JavaScript console](img/4_robot_read_name_property_in_console.png)

The console displays the value of the `name` property. It is the string, "Marty".

***Ask the class***
> Why didn't we use `this` when accessing Marty's name?

    Because `this` is abstract within the class. When an object is instantiated, its
    properties are concrete, and can be accessed by using the dot operator on the 
    specific instance.

Now we have a class that defines `Robot` objects, and it creates instances with the name "Marty".

***Ask the class***
> What if we want to create another robot named Phyllis? 

    Encourage students to puzzle this out. One solution might be to create a new
    class, `PhyllisRobot`, where `constructor()` sets the name to "Phyllis". Another
    might be to modify the `Robot` class to set the name to "Phyllis" instead of
    "Marty". If only there were a way to set the robot name at the time of 
    object instantiation...

A very useful feature of `constructor()` is that it can take arguments passed
to the class when a new object instance is created. This allows us to reuse the
same class to instantiate objects with different properties. Let's use this
feature to pass a robot's name into the `Robot` class when we create a new
object instance. First, we will modify `constructor()` to expect a `name`
parameter. Refresh your browser and enter the following into the console:

```javascript
class Robot {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
}
```

To create a robot name Phyllis, we can simply...

```javascript
const phyllis = new Robot('Phyllis');
```

We can see that our new `Robot` instance is named Phyllis.

Feel free to spend a minute creating more robots with different names!








Backlog
===
***Ask the class***
> What are some other attributes that might belong to a robot?

    The sky's the limit on this one. Obvious properties include name, height, weight,
    speed, fuel, color, gender...


***Ask the class***
> Can you think of a real-world object that might be difficult to express using
> a **class**? Which **properites** and **methods** seem difficult to model? 

    Try to model some of the students' suggestions with appropriate properties
    and methods. Hopefully you will find an opportunity where some forthcoming
    concepts will help, providing a segue into the next section.
